# A314-500-HDL

This repository contains the Verilog HDL sources used for the Intel MAX 10 FPGA
on the A314-500 and A314-600 boards.

The hardware design files for those boards are available in these repositories:

- <https://github.com/Eriond/A314-500-PCB>
- <https://github.com/Eriond/A314-600-PCB>

The A314 software is available in this repository:

- <https://github.com/niklasekstrom/a314>

## Building

The Verilog source code used to generate a programming object file (.pof) is
available in the [HDL](HDL) directory.
You can compile the design using
[Quartus Prime Lite Edition](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite).
